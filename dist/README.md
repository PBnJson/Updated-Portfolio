# Updated Profile

I updated my profile to be completely responsive, better look, navigable to different pages, and updated with work.

Styling was done with SASS. If something breaks, it will be because of the SASS compiler. Please let me know if this happens... I know what to do.

A single JS page was needed, with very few lines of code. This handles hiding/showing the navigation menu.

## Description

This was a very fun project. NPM was utilized for SASS. SASS has some very interesting features such as if statements, for loops, and referencing without using variables. All the links for my work will open a new window. This was done in line, but I will be moving the JS I used into the index.js file.

### Home

The home screen background is an artform called 'camera obscura.'

The menu button is comprised of 3 divs. Changing shape is done with transform, translate3d, and JavaScript to show or hide the menu. You could potentially create a menu button with as many divs as you want and then transform/translate those divs to create many different shapes.
